        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm the youngest of seven siblings 🤸, I'm a "she" and I've lived in Buenos Aires,
            Argentina since I was born on April 13th 1992.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was a kid, I used to write poetry🖋. Once I became a teenager, I started writing short stories and a
            soap opera which I haven't finished yet (after 12 years of having started it👵). Nowadays, I'm also used to
            writing
            essays besides all of the previously mentioned, and I've somehow started a new soap opera which I hope to
            finish
            before the next 12 years (haha🙈).
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I ask my son to ilustrate my short stories
            if I see him in the mood to do so, since he's one hell of an artist🤯 and he makes the best drawings no
            one could ever imagine an 8 year old could make✨.

        </p>
        <p>
            At the age of 19 I became a mom and I've been raising my son on my own for the last 9 years (he's turning
            9 on
            July 24th💕). I have always managed to work part-time to be able to drop him at kindergarden (and later
            on
            at primary school🏫) and to pick him up afterwards, as well as to provide us with much more than we actually
            needed🌞. That's how I worked as a Data Entry in 3 different companies for almost 7 years until late 2019.
            During those years I've studied a wide variety of specialties to find my own⏲.
        </p>
        <p>

            My true passions have always been ✒writing, singing🎤🗣🚿 and reading📚. But there are plenty of stuff I'm
            also
            really into, such as playing sports (it used to be artistic gymnastics and swimming🏊 when I was younger and
            currently it is weight lifting🏋️‍♀️, hiit and yoga🧘‍♀️). I also like baking both salty and sweet
            recipes🍽 , taking
            long walks,
            swing dancing, and doing all sort of things with my son💝.

            It wasn't until the beginning of 2020 when Front End Development completely haunted my attention 👁👁 and I
            could
            not stop learning and coding beyond time and space ever since 🚀💻. I've been spending much more time per
            day
            coding than I dare to admit😳. And nowadays reading books, baking and writing short stories happen to be in
            second place to me when I have some free time to spend doing something for myself🙋‍♀️.
            Coding and learning about technology have come to be a major interest in my life since I took my first
            timid steps in this field checking out what freecodecamp.org was about👀.
        </p>
        <p>
            👩‍👦 Single parenting taught me how there's probably not one thing people aren't capable of accomplishing💪
            when
            we do
            what we really ought to do🏃‍♀️ and when we commit to it with every fibre of our mind🎯, our body and our
            soul💞. Or that's how I felt towards my circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience leads me to believe that it doesn't truly matter how much we have rather than
            making the
            best out of everything we actually have. And to me, being grateful everyday for so many things such as
            having the best kid in the
            whole
            world 🌎 is already so fulfilling and lets me know for sure that there isn't a thing I wouldn't strive for
            to
            make
            our family happy, strong,
            healthy, warm and well educated✔.

            <h2>Fun facts about anaclette (or just facts):</h2>

            <p> 🔹I don't care for routines or doing the same things week after week, month after month. I like
                spicing
                things
                up and improvising to feel like siezing the day.</p>
            <p> 🔸I like learning something new almost everyday and/or improving what I already know. Achieving short or
                medium
                term goals is something I actively seek to keep me away from boredom.</p>
            <p> 🔹I love being surrounded by people who have something meaningful to share and who expose
                themselves
                from an honest place and who tend to constructive self-criticism, to self improvement and to
                introspection. </p>
            <p> 🔸I'm affectionate, steady, more of a listener rather than a talker, loyal and someone you can always
                count on.</p>
            <p> 🔹I'm fond of cultivating my interests and I'm attracted by people who do the same.</p>
            <p> 🔸I fantasize about (or actually plan on) living abroad.</p>
            <p> 🎁 I think life's too short to keep ourselves from choosing wisely how to invest our time. "Pay
                attention to what you pay attention to". </p>
