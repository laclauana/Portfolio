      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm the youngest of seven siblings 🤸, I'm a "she" and I've lived in
        Buenos Aires, Argentina since I was born on April 13th 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a kid, I used to write poetry🖋. Once I became a teenager, I
        started writing short stories and a soap opera which I haven't finished
        yet (after 12 years of having started it👵). Nowadays, I'm also used to
        writing essays besides all of the previously mentioned, and I've somehow
        started a new soap opera which I hope to finish before the next 12 years
        (haha🙈).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I ask my son to ilustrate my short stories if I see him in the
        mood to do so, since he's one hell of an artist🤯 and he makes the best
        drawings no one could ever imagine an 8 year old could make✨.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the age of 19 I became a mom and I've been raising my son on my own
        for the last 9 years (he's turning 9 on July 24th💕). I have always
        managed to work part-time to be able to drop him at kindergarden (and
        later on at primary school🏫) and to pick him up afterwards, as well as
        to provide us with much more than we actually needed🌞. That's how I
        worked as a Data Entry in 3 different companies for almost 7 years until
        late 2019. During those years I've studied a wide variety of specialties
        to find my own⏲.
      </p>
      <p>
        My true passions have always been ✒writing, singing🎤🗣🚿 and reading📚.
        But there are plenty of stuff I'm also really into, such as playing
        sports (it used to be artistic gymnastics and swimming🏊 when I was
        younger and currently it is weight lifting🏋️‍♀️, hiit and yoga🧘‍♀️). I also
        like baking both salty and sweet recipes🍽 , taking long walks, swing
        dancing, and doing all sort of things with my son💝.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't until the beginning of 2020 when Front End Development
        completely haunted my attention 👁👁 and I could not stop learning and
        coding beyond time and space ever since 🚀💻. I've been spending much
        more time per day coding than I dare to admit😳. And nowadays reading
        books, baking and writing short stories happen to be in second place to
        me when I have some free time to spend doing something for myself🙋‍♀️.
        Coding and learning about technology have come to be a major interest in
        my life since I took my first timid steps in this field checking out
        what freecodecamp.org was about👀.
      </p>
      <p>
        👩‍👦 Single parenting taught me how there's probably not one thing people
        aren't capable of accomplishing💪 when we do what we really ought to
        do🏃‍♀️ and when we commit to it with every fibre of our mind🎯, our body
        and our soul💞. Or that's how I felt towards my circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience leads me to believe that it doesn't truly matter how much
        we have rather than making the best out of everything we actually have.
        And to me, being grateful everyday for so many things such as having the
        best kid in the whole world 🌎 is already so fulfilling and lets me know
        for sure that there isn't a thing I wouldn't strive for to make our
        family happy, strong, healthy, warm and well educated✔.

        <h2>Fun facts about Ana (or just facts):</h2>

        <p>
          🔹I don't care for routines or doing the same things week after week,
          month after month. I like spicing things up and improvising to feel
          like siezing the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          🔸I like learning something new almost everyday and/or improving what
          I already know. Achieving short or medium term goals is something I
          actively seek to keep me away from boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
          🔹I love being surrounded by people who have something meaningful to
          share and who expose themselves from an honest place and who tend to
          constructive self-criticism, to self improvement and to introspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          🔸I'm affectionate, steady, more of a listener rather than a talker,
          loyal and someone you can always count on.
        </p>
        <p>
          🔹I'm fond of cultivating my interests and I'm attracted by people who
          do the same.
        </p>
        <p>🔸I fantasize about (or actually plan on) living abroad.</p>
        <p>
          🎁 I think life's too short to keep ourselves from choosing wisely how
          to invest our time. "Pay attention to what you pay attention to".
