# Ada ITW first project

## Personal webpage using HTML5, CSS, lots of joy and a hint of excitement!

This is the very first evaluation process that trainee Front-End developers at Ada ITW are going through. So far, IÂ´ve been having the greatest time learning the most efficient standard procedures when designing a website.
You're welcome to take a glance at the model website we were based on:
